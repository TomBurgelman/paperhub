# Paperhub

This will be a general website for scientific papers (*main focus in the beginning will be Physics*), currently in progress!🏗️

## Database

The website will be a giant database, which will be easier to navigate than the standard paper databases currently on the market.
I will only use open-source (public) papers initially in the database.`-> Arxiv and Semantic Scholar databases`


## Daily Papers

The biggest part of this website will be the most recent scientific (daily), displaying the most recent papers, hopefully at least one a day.

These will be given on the main page, with each with an upvote button to increase popularity 📈.

### Weekly / Monthly

The most important papers per week or month will be available (side projects).
